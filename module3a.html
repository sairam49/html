        <p>William Shakespeare was baptized on April 26, 1564, in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. From roughly 1594 onward he was an important member of the Lord Chamberlain’s Men company of theatrical players. Written records give little indication of the way in which Shakespeare’s professional life molded his artistry. All that can be deduced is that over the course of 20 years, Shakespeare wrote plays that capture the complete range of human emotion and conflict.

            <h3>SONNET: </h3>
            <abbr title="first sonnet">FS:</abbr>
            <p><em>From fairest creatures we desire increase,
            That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
            But as the riper should by time decease,
            His tender heir might bear his memory:
            But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
            Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
            Making a famine where abundance lies,
            Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
            Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
            And only herald to the gaudy spring,
            Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
            And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
            Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
            To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.</em></p>
